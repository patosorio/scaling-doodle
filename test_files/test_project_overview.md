# Project: "Talicada" Luxury Tours — Booking & CRM MVP

## Context
Talicada is a high-end Moroccan tour operator offering fully curated, private trips. The current process for handling inquiries, itinerary building, and vendor coordination is manual (email, WhatsApp, spreadsheets). The company needs an MVP to standardize intake, speed up proposal turnaround, and reduce back-and-forth with clients.

## Goals (Business-Friendly)
- Convert more inquiries into paid bookings with faster proposals.
- Keep all trip details (guests, dates, hotels, drivers, activities) in one place.
- Provide a clear status view from first contact to trip completion.
- Reduce errors in bookings and vendor communications.

## Scope (MVP)
- Lead intake form (web) with essential traveler info and preferences.
- Internal CRM: pipeline stages (New → Qualified → Proposal Sent → Booked → In Trip → Completed).
- Itinerary builder with day-by-day plan and price summary.
- Vendor coordination log (requests, confirmations, costs).
- One-click export of a client-friendly PDF proposal.
- Simple role-based access (Owner, Agent).

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- Dynamic pricing engine.
- Mobile apps.
- Full accounting; only a price summary and booking deposit tracking.

## Success Metrics
- Proposal turnaround time < 24h.
- ≥ 25% increase in inquiry-to-booking conversion within 3 months.
- ≥ 50% reduction in itinerary errors / rework.

## Stakeholders
- Business Owner (approvals, margins).
- Travel Designer/Agent (daily user).
- Operations (vendor relations).
- Clients (receive proposals, confirm trips).

## Constraints
- Budget: MVP-level investment.
- Timeline: 6–8 weeks for a usable pilot.
- Tools: Web app preferred; integrate email/WhatsApp later.

## Notes
- The proposal document must feel premium: clear visuals, concise copy, transparent pricing.
- Data privacy and client trust are critical.
