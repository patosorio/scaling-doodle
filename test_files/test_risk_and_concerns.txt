Business-Friendly Risks & Concerns

1) Slow Vendor Responses
- Impact: Delays proposals; clients may book elsewhere.
- Mitigation: Track request timestamps and auto-reminders; show “pending items” in the proposal with clear expectations.

2) Over-Promising Availability
- Impact: Last-minute changes hurt trust and margins.
- Mitigation: Require vendor confirmation status before sending final proposal; mark tentative items clearly.

3) Inconsistent Pricing & Margin Visibility
- Impact: Lost profit or confusing quotes.
- Mitigation: Standardize cost inputs; show margin only to Owner; lock version when exported.

4) Manual Errors in Itineraries
- Impact: Wrong dates, missed transfers, unhappy clients.
- Mitigation: Templates, required fields, sanity checks (e.g., travel time between cities).

5) Data Privacy & Client Trust
- Impact: Brand damage if mismanaged.
- Mitigation: Store minimal PII; restrict access by role; clear data retention policy.

6) Scope Creep
- Impact: Delays MVP, bloats budget.
- Mitigation: Strict MVP scope; backlog for nice-to-haves; time-box pilot.
